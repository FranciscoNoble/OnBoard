# Esgualepado Line-Follower (ESGLF)

Basically, ESGLF is a LDR array meant to serve as a full packged sensor to follow lines made by Team Esgualepado, from Brazil. The LDRs displacement is strategic with Robocup 2024 lines. The LDRs will be connected to an Arduino for processing.

It's going to cost something arround 50-60 dollars, it depends on the shipping, the board itself will cost like, 3 dollars for green and 14 if I choose other color

This PCB idea started after I had many problems building the circuit 100% by hand. After a week or so the circuit started to fail and so, I started my journey on designing this PCB. The biggest challange was to design it as on a single layer, as I was planning to build the circuit by myself. It was a fun road and I'm glad how things turned out.
